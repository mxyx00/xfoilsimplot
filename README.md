# xfoilsimplot
Plots desired X-Foil Simulations

@run_plot --> script with all the different files, can be un-commented and ran according to needs.
@xfoilsimplot --> script which, according to the kind of xfoil sim ran, will produce respective plots.

** Important**
In order for the code to properly work, the folders must be formatted as follows:
The MatLab code and naca coordinate file must be in a folder together. 
There should be 2 subfolders titled "mach 0" and "mach 0.012"
In these subfolders, there should be subfolders with each desired Reynolds number. Format should be: "re = 1 x 10^4". All re should be adjusted for a magnitude of 10^4. 
**

^^ The formatting is subject to change and future updates to the code may simplify the method and allow for more freedom of folder organization.
